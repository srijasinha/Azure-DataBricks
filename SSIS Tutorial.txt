SSIS (Sql server INtegration Service)-

1)its a ETL tool to Extract,load, Transform
2)used mostly in Datawarehousing projects
3)Used for Data Migration projects
4)Database maintaince activies

Architecture of SSIS - 

1)Data sources - Files,Excl,cloud Apps,Databases

2)Data Preparation - (copy the Data souces) data to  Database called (stageing) - Datawarehouse(build fact and Dimension table)

3)SAAS - SaaS stands for Software as a Service, and it's a cloud computing model that allows users to access software applications and services over the internet through a subscription. 
- In this Data is in Tabular form or Multidimensional 

4)Power Bi Desktop - Data is moved in power Bi desktop

5)Power Bi Report server - Report is created then published on Report server.

1)SIS(sql server Integration Service)- It comes under Business Inteligence
2)SSAS(sql  server Anyalysis Service)
3)SSRS(sql server Reporting service)- Data tools

***SSIS Herarchy***-

*To debug use - Data Viewer

*SSIS Architecture-

1)Control Flow - It controls the flow of execution. It has only task.
Ex -         load employee data
             sucess|    |  Faliure
				   |    |
call Batch execution	 Load log error  
				   

2)Data Flow -ETL process can be done here. It has souce, Transformation, Destination. It read data row by row.

Demo - control Flow Practical - Loading a file from local to Database(SSIS).
 1)Data Flow- Drag and drop Data Flow task in  control flow.(name - Load csv file in DB)
 2)Connection string - careate a connection string.
    a)Source - Give path
	b)Destination - Give Path
3)Go inside Data flow Task - Perform ETL.
     Flat file sources - Read from source
	 OLEDB Connection - Load data in DB (destination) - Do mapping of table
4)Execte Task or run Packages - in control flow - step 1

**Transformation**-

1) load data(local server) to database (use ssis) - demo as above
2) Data conversion-  
		a)Data Transform Task- Souce column name aand destination column name and type should be matched correctly.
                               To change data type in Table use Data Transformation task.
							   
		b)Derived column Task- To add a new column we use this task.(Ex - Extract only 3 leters from a location column)
        
		c)Copy column - It will create a copy of column in table.
		
		d)Character Map - To conver a column data in Upperccase or lower case.
		
		e) sort - It can be Ascending or decending order column.
		
		f)Multicast -create multiple copies of input data and load in Destination.
		
		g)Conditional split - Write condition in  SQL Query.
		
		h)Union - Combining a data set from all data set and give a single result.
		
		i)Union all - It will combine the data set and remove duplicate from data set.Sorting is not importantin union all.
		Ex-		cust1- cust2- cust3 (Input file)
			       |
				   Union All				  
                OLEDB connection(Destination)
		
		j)Merge - It will merge more than 2 files.Merge required only two input at a time to merge more than 2 files use another sort task and merge task.(similar to union).Sorting is important in merge.
		
	Ex- 	  cust1- cust2- cust3 (Input file)
		     |
		  sort1- sort2- sort 3
		     |     |     |
			 Merge1---------Merge2
			 |
			 OLEDB connection (Destination)
			 
(output of cust1 and cust2)- Merge1

        k)Merge Join - When data is comming from 2 sources and combine a record need to add new column.
			 
***Control Flow Task*** 			 
1)Execute SQL - To clear the existing table ,then load the data.Write the query to delete table .
  Ex-     Execute SQL Task
              |
		  Data Flow Task(inside this union all operation, etc)
		
2)File System Task - To remove the files from folder, move , or remove specefic character from file.
		  
3)Exceute process Task - To run a batch, call a exe file process execution.
		  
		  
*Precedence constraint in control Flow -*
1)File system Task
2)Remove the data
3)Data Flow Task- load cust data
4)if sucess - Update customer Info, else Failure Execute Process Task
5)Execute SQL Task
6)Data Flow Task - load sales data

***Sequence cointainer Task-****
Grouping of two steps can be put in squesence cointainer. - grouped in a single task.

**variables**- To make a experesion dimically we use variables.

**Expresions**- They are conditions
DATEPART("DD",GETDAT())>25 - Result - True

**For each cointainer**- To repeat an activity again and again.

**For Loop scointainer**- For Loop container evaluates an expression and repeats its workflow until the expression evaluates to False.

**Event Handler-** An event handler is similar to a package.how to trigger a email when my package or tasks failin SSIS,how to execute a task before particular task begins in SSIS,how to execute a task after particular task ends in SSIS.

**Execute Package Task-** how to call a package from another package in SSIS,what is parent and child packages in SSIS. Ex- V1-<V2-<V3 package will execute.(control flow of execution of package)

**Types of Transformations-**

1)Syncronous Transformation- No of records Input = Number of records output.
  Incomming rows and passes them in the Data Flow one row at a time.
		Ex- Flat file source-< Derieved column-<Data conversion-<OLDEB conversion

2)ASyncronous Transformation- All Data need to be read before it release to Destination.
        Ex- Flat File Source-<sort-<Aggregate-<OLDEB conversion

**Performance Improvement in Packages Execution-**
when we run task in Control Flow in parallel then we can have performance Improvment faster.

**Integration Services (SSIS) Server and Catlog-**
1)Its is instance of the SQL Server Database Engine that hosts the SSISDB database. The database stores the following objects: packages, projects, parameters, permissions, server properties, and operational history.

2)we can deploy SSIS projects in SQL server managment studio by- Integration Service Catlog folder.

**SQL server Agent Job-**

To create a job and run at a particular time.
Sqql Server Agent is installled in SSMS.
